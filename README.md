# ToughDecisions

Tough decisions is a full-stack application that allows users to create an account, and play a multiplayer game where they and other participants can create a question or prompt, and have all participants vote on which option they prefer. The results are then displayed, along with a percentage for the number of votes for each option.

The app is built using React for the front end framework, NOSQL and GraphQl for the backend, Apollo for the backend server, and Socket.io for the multiplayer elements. React Bootstrap and CSS were used for the styling and layout of the front end. The app is deployed and hosted on Heroku.

This was a collaborative project done by garret94(https://github.com/garrettj94), brianmckennaman(https://github.com/brianmckennaman), BrandonN64(https://github.com/BrandonN64), and ChristianSmith46(https://github.com/ChristianSmith46).
